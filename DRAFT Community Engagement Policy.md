# IETF LLC Community Engagement Policy

## Background

### Scope

This policy applies to all Covered Individuals of the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC).

Covered Individuals include the IETF LLC Board Directors, employees and contractors, as well as any volunteers and agents who are formally authorized to act on behalf of IETF LLC in some capacity and are considered by the LLC to be acting in that capacity.

Covered Individuals do not include IETF participants, IRTF participants, IESG members, the IRTF Chair, IAB members, IAB program members, working group chairs, research group chairs, directorate participants, the Independent Submissions Editor, the Independent Submissions Editorial Board, NOC volunteers, Tools team volunteers, the Ombudsteam, the Sergeants-at-arms, trustees of the IETF Trust, and any individual not involved in the IETF, except if such individuals are formally authorized as Covered Individuals (such as an IETF LLC Board Director).

Any volunteers and agents who are considered Covered Individuals are, for the purposes of this policy, to follow the policy as it applies to contractors.

### Purpose of this Policy

This policy sets out the general approach, scope and mechanisms used by Covered Individuals when engaging with the community.  This policy does not apply to the management of RFPs or contracts.

### Context

[RFC 8711 section 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8711#section-4) sets out the scope and principles of the IETF LLC and in particular, notes that the LLC is the administrative support organisation to the IETF/IRTF/IAB and has no authority over the standards development activities.  The IETF LLC is expected to implement community requirements as specified in the form of BCPs and to take advice from the community as specified in informational RFCs and as provided in consultations.

This policy should be read in conjunction with the [IETF LLC Code of Conduct](https://ietf.org/about/administration/policies-procedures/code-of-conduct/) and nothing here should be taken as overriding or amending that policy.

## Development of RFCs

The policy on engagement in RFC development activities depends on the role and the nature of the RFCs being developed.

### Staff, Secretariat, RPC

Staff, Secretariat and RPC are not expected to have any engagement regarding the content of technical standards except as required in their defined administrative roles.  For Secretariat and RPC this may occasionally include contributing to or authoring RFCs related to their area of work.  

There are a set of administrative subjects where staff, Secretariat and RPC may contribute to community processes, if they follow the rules set out in this policy.  At no point could they be considered as community volunteers and all engagement is in their contracted role.

Those administrative subjects include:
* IETF Meetings
* Tools
* Finances / Fundraising
* Contracting
* Compliance
* Communications
* Any other subject within the scope of IETF LLC role. 
* Any administrative subject where staff and/or the Secretariat may have professional skills that can assist the activity.

When contributing to community discussions for any of these subjects, staff, Secretariat and RPC should aim to be supportive and helpful to the process and should not limit or otherwise interfere with the ability of the community to engage.  

Any opinions expressed by staff, Secretariat or RPC should only be about the practicalities of a current or proposed situation where that is relevant to the scope of the IETF LLC, and should be based on evidence or professional expertise.  

Most importantly, as the IETF LLC will be required to implement any final standard, care needs to be taken not to introduce a conflict of interest whereby staff, Secretariat or RPC are pushing for a specific outcome.

### Board and Contractors other than Secretariat/RPC

It is recognised that some of the board and some contractors may also be community volunteers engaged in the full range of  standards development process and there is no expectation that this engagement must cease when they assume either role.  Some contracted roles may require contractors to be explicitly prohibited from acting as community volunteers.

Contractors are expected to ensure that any engagement as a volunteer is not a conflict of interest with their contractual role.

Contractors are also expected to ensure that it is always clear to those being engaged with, if the contractor is engaging as a contractor or as a volunteer, as assumptions may vary between people and situations.

Contractors should note that even while contributing as a volunteer, the Code of Conduct still applies.

## Community Feedback

### Consultations

Consultations are the most important means by which the IETF LLC seeks feedback from the community to inform its decision making and all consultations should be structured and well managed to maximise the opportunity for the community to respond. 

Well structured means each consultation should be based on some form of document or email and should have a defined finish date.  The document should set out the context to the consultation and any specific questions that the IETF LLC seeks feedback on.  Consultations should normally run for two weeks with a minimum time of 48 hours for urgent consultations.  

Well managed means that all feedback is tracked and either incorporated or the reasons for non-incorporated are clearly noted.  If the consultation is on specific text then new text may be produced during the consultation to respond to the feedback as it is raised.

When a consultation is complete and a decision made on the feedback received, then the community will be informed of this.

### Surveys

The IETF LLC regularly conducts surveys of the community to inform its decision making and to support the decision making of other parts of the IETF/IRTF/IAB.  
Only data that is voluntarily provided by the respondents is to be collected and used.  Data should not be requested that identifies the respondent.
Survey results should generally be made public in the form of a report or data tables but with care taken to preserve the anonymity of respondents.  The results may be redacted if they contain material the IETF LLC thinks is inappropriate, such as advertising material or identifying people by name.

## NomCom
There is clear potential for a conflict of interest if any staff or contractor is able to use the NomCom process to retaliate against a LLC board member for a contractual dispute or disciplinary action, or to advocate for a board candidate who is expected to provide favourable treatment.
Staff and all contractors may not volunteer on the IETF NomCom.

When the NomCom seeks feedback on candidates and general feedback on the roles, staff, Secretariat and RPC can only provide general feedback on the roles and not on any individual.  Contractors can provide feedback on both roles and individuals, except for individuals who are being considered for the IETF LLC board.

## Mechanisms

### Published Documents

The IETF LLC sits outside of and supports the standards development process. The IETF LLCâ€™s published documents do not reflect any form of community consensus but reflect solely the position of the IETF LLC.  These documents may be long lived or may change both frequently and rapidly depending on the circumstance.  Consequently, the IETF LLC does not ordinarily use the Internet-Draft (I-D) format for its documents and does not publish RFCs but instead chooses a document format and publication mechanism that is appropriate to each class of document that it publishes. The one exception is where the IETF LLC is expected to use the I-D format to input into a community managed process. 

### Announcements

The IETF LLC sends an announcement to ietf-announce, which may just include pointers rather than substantive content, for the following events:
* For all important stages of a consultation, including  initiation, any reminders,  extension, closing and the final report.
* For all important stages of a survey, including  initiation, any reminders,  extension, closing and the final report.
* When a new IETF LLC policy has been added or an existing policy amended or withdrawn.
* For each new IETF LLC blog post.
* In advance of each board meeting.
* For all important IETF meeting related information.

A register of all IETF LLC announcements to ietf-announce is maintained as a page on the IETF website,

Other announcement lists may be used for more specific announcements.

### Mailing Lists

Staff will, at a minimum, monitor the following lists for any discussions relevant to the IETF LLC:
* ietf-admin@ietf.org (a new list)
* ietf@ietf
* tools-discuss
* wgchairs
* tools-arch
* attendees lists
* All lists associated with GEN area working groups, documents, and pre-working-group efforts.

The primary list for the discussion of LLC administrative issues is ietf-admin@ietf.org  and is used as the reply-to address for IETF LLC consultations.  While this list is only used by the LLC for administrative discussions, with the IESG continuing to use ietf@ietf.org, it is named more generically to make it easier for newcomers to recognise its significance.
