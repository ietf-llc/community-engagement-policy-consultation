## Volunteering in the IETF

It is recognised that some Covered Individuals may also be community volunteers engaged in the full range of standards development process and there is no expectation that this engagement must cease when they become a Covered Individual. Some Covered Roles may require Covered Individuals to be explicitly prohibited from acting as community volunteers.

Covered Individuals are expected to ensure that any engagement as a volunteer is not a conflict of interest with their Covered Role(s).

Covered Individuals are also expected to ensure that it is always clear to those being engaged with, whether the Covered Individual is engaging in their Covered Role(s) or as a volunteer, as assumptions may vary between people and situations.

Covered Individuals should note that even while contributing as a volunteer, the Code of Conduct still applies.
