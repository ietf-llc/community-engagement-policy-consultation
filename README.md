The IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC) has drafted a proposed IETF LLC Community Engagement Policy [1] that sets out how IETF LLC board, staff and contractors will engage with the IETF community.  

The policy sets out: 
* what involvement board, staff and contractors may have in the the development of RFCs;
* what engagement they may have with the NomCom; 
* How the IETF LLC seeks community feedback;
* What mechanisms the IETF LLC uses for community engagement.

The policy proposes a new mailing list ietf-admin@ietf.org for the discussion of IETF LLC related matters.

The IETF LLC now seeks community feedback on this proposed policy.  Please provide feedback by 26 October 2020 00:00 UTC.  Feedback can be provided by any of the following methods:

* Raising an issue on this Github repository
* Direct to the IETF Executive Director at exec-director@ietf.org
* Direct to the IETF LLC Board (not including the IETF Executive Director) at llc-board-only@ietf.org
* To the ietf@ietf.org list
